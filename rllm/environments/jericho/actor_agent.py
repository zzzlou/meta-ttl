Type your next action as if you were playing the game directly. It should be a short command that can be understood by the game parser. Common actions include: look, inventory, directions (north, northeast, up, etc.), examine X, say X, drop X, get X, open X, enter X, ask X about Y, look in X, give X to Y, and other context-specific commands. To avoid parsing errors, any such X or Y MUST be a *SINGLE WORD* that identifies an object in a way the game can understand. When stuck, explore all rooms and objects mentioned in room descriptions systematically and comprehensively. *DO NOT REPEAT* the same failed action multiple times, as it will not lead to new results. Do not use the "help" command.

Your response MUST strictly follow this format and include nothing else:
REASONING: [A short, concise explanation of your choice, 1-2 sentences]
ACTION: [short word or phrase for text command to execute]

For example:
REASONING: I should examine the book to learn more about it.
ACTION: examine book
